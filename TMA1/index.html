            <h3>Analysis and Design</h3>
            <p>My focus is implementing my knowledge with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and creating a basic and minimalist web applications. Each web application has a welcome page which contains most of the links needed for users to access. Welcome pages are in the index.html because that is the landing page of every website.</p>

            <p>For part 1, I used my XML knowledge to translate my resume into an XML file. The design is to partition my personal information, education, and work experiences.</p>

            <p>For part 2, I used my HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge to design a website that teaches and challenges users about the basic fundamentals of using the HTML/CSS/JavaScript technologies. The design is to have a welcome page that guides the users on how to navigate through the website with page descriptions, and instructions to follow.</p>

            <p>For part 3, I used what I learned with HTML Canvas and designed a image slideshow that has buttons to start/stop, next/previous, random/sequential, and a dropdown menu to choose transformation effects depending on the user's preference.</p>

            <p>Part 4 has the utility tools such as Measurement Converters, Mortgage calculator, and a compound interest calculator. These utilities are all accessible through the welcome page.</p>
